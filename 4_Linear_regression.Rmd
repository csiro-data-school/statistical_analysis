source("stats_helpers.R")
```

> We'll create perfect linear data, and linear data with normal (Gaussian)
random noise, and non-normal random noise, data with outliers,
and nonlinear data.

Let's start with the basic relationship y = 2 * x + 5 and look at that over the values from 1 to 10.
We'll then add some noise to this data by sampling or change it from a linear relationship.

```{r data_setup}
# the data has already been created in stats_helpers.R

test_data
```

>  Fit a linear model for each of these situations and produce diagnostic plots. Note how 
they look when the assumptions of linear regression are violated.

We can use the `perfect_linear` data as an example for how to perform the analysis, then you can 
repeat it with the other datasets.
First, we'll take a look at the data before we start to analyse it

```{r data_exploration}
perfect_plot <- test_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = perfect_linear)) +
  geom_point()

perfect_plot
```
It appears as though our `perfect_linear` values increase with increasing `x` values. We can build a
linear regression that models this relationship using the `lm` command. This function also uses the 
formula notation that we have used several times already.

```{r linear_regression}
perfect_model <- lm(perfect_linear ~ x, data = test_data)

#Short summary of the model
perfect_model

#Longer summary of the model
summary(perfect_model)
```

Just printing the linear model out provides a basic look at the results. Remember that the equation
for a line is $Y = aX + b$. In fitting the linear model with `lm`, we are trying to determine the 
"best" values of `a` and `b` that minimise the amount of error between the straight line and our data
points.

The output from the model is telling us that the best estimate for `a` is 2.0 and for `b` is 5.0. 
Which is to be expected because we created the data with the formula $Y = 2*X + 5$.

The more detailed output from `summary(perfect_model)` gives additional information that can be used 
to validate and interpret our model. 

We can add the result from our model on top of our initial plot to see the relationship:

```{r regression_results}
#Manually
perfect_plot + 
  geom_abline(intercept = 5, slope = 2)

#Using geom_smooth()
perfect_plot +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

A good way to check your model is by producing some summary plots that test the underlying 
statistical assumptions (can you remember what they are?). 

You can get some summary plots of your model (including the residuals), by calling `plot` on the 
result of running `lm`. Alternatively, if you install the `ggResidpanel` package you can produce
diagnostic plots using `resid_panel`.

The diagnostic plots from `resid_panel` show:
*  Residual plot -residuals vs predicted values - test constant variance
*  QQ plot - tests normality assumption
*  Index Plot - additional plot to test assumptions
*  Histogram of residues - check if any skewness is present

```{r diagnostic_plots}
# Install the package with 
# install.packages(ggResidpanel)

library(ggResidpanel)

resid_panel(perfect_model)
```
**Note:** for the perfect linear model, these summary plots are not that useful because there aren't
any true residuals from a perfect relationship. These plots will be much more informative when you 
start to use them with more realistic data.

```{r perfect_linear_example}
#Exploratory plotting
ggplot(test_data, aes(x = x, y = perfect_linear)) + geom_point()

#Fit linear model
perfect_model <- lm(perfect_linear ~ x, data = test_data)

#Diagnostic plots
ggResidpanel::resid_panel(perfect_model)
```

Now you can complete the exercise with the four other instances from the `test_data` data frame. 
These four column are `normal_noise`, `non_normal_noise`, `outliers`, and `non_linear`. How do the 
diagnostic plots look when the assumptions of a linear regression are violated?

```{r linear_regression_assumptions}
# Plot relationship
test_data %>% 
  ggplot(_____)

# Model relationship with lm()
lm(_____ ~ _____, data = test_data)

# Check model result
summary(_____)

# Test model assumptions
resid_panel(_____)
```

## Extension

If you have completed the exercise looking at these artificial datasets, try the same process with
the inbuilt `iris` dataset.

#### About the iris data
From `?iris`: The iris data set has measurements (in cm)  of the variables sepal length
and width and petal length and width, respectively,for 50 flowers from
each of 3 species of iris. The species are Iris setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

The four measurements in `iris` are `Sepal.Length`, `Sepal.Width`, `Petal.Length`, and `Petal.Width`.
Create some scatter plots comparing pairs of these measurements. Select a pair and perform a linear
regression on the relationship. What does the linear model say about the relationship, and are the
model's assumptions appropriate for this data?

```{r iris_regression}
# Check raw data
iris

# Plot relationship

# Model relationship

# Check model result

# Check model assumptions
```
